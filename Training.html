        Mathematics, Accounting, Geography, Physics/Chemistry, IT, English, Afrikaans. These are the subjects that comprised majority of my 5 years of highschool. My top favourite being Math & Physics, with accounting and geography not too far
        behind. My biggest lesson from high school would be that we are all on our own journey fulfilling our own passion.

        The start of an unforgettable journey in my aviation career.
        Instruction of the finest from my SPL (Student Pilot Licence ) up to my Private Pilot Licence (PPL) and Night Rating. By the end of 2013 I had achieved my PPl, with privelages allowing me to fly as a Pilot in command on a single engine
        aircraft carrying passengers privately and not for anyform of remuneration. Not long after in January 2014 I obtained my night rating and begun doing majority of my hour building towards my Commercial Pilots Licence (CPL).

        The pinnacle point in ones flying career. I had just moved across from Africa Aviation Academy (Rand Airport) to Aeronav Academy(Lanseria Internation Airport) and withing 4 months I obtained my Instrument Rating, Multi-Engine Ratine and my
        CPL. My privelages were now extended to being able to fly multi-engined aircraft, in IMC conditions, with meticulous planning, carrying either cargo or passengers for Remuneration. And so began the journey of not working a day in my life and
        doing what I love.
